3x3 Macropad -- custom PCB designed in KiCad and programmed in Arduino IDE using C++. Case designed in _______ and 3D printed.

# purpose
After losing access to my mechanical keyboard I used for a while, and just relying on my laptop's built-in keyboard, I had the desire to make my own mechanical keyboard completely from scratch. This macropad serves as a precursor to a 60% keyboard I hope to create during the upcoming academic year using a bare ATMega32U4 Microcontroller rather than an Arduino Micro, and to test the waters with the project on a smaller scale. 

It made more sense to stick with the Arduino Micro for this summer project since I will be strictly using through-hole soldering. With the 60% project, having regular access to WPI's reflow oven will yield hopefully better results using SMT soldering (hand soldering all of the pins on the microcontroller sounds like a nightmare).

# Rough BOM
- Arduino Pro Micro
- Keyboard Switches
- Diodes (through-hole soldered)
