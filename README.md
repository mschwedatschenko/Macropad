# macropad
3x3 Macropad -- custom PCB designed in KiCad and programmed in Arduino IDE using C++. Case designed in _______ and 3D printed.

# purpose
A precursor to a 60% keyboard I hope to create during the upcoming academic year. This macropad serves to test the waters with the project on a smaller scale, and having regular access to WPI's reflow oven will yield hopefully better results using SMT soldering.
